mayor s rival in a   local election  the court  in its     ruling  found that jeffrey heffernan  a now former member of paterson s police force  was not in fact exercising his rights to freedom of association under the u s  constitution s first amendment because he picked up the sign for his mother and not himself  but the justices decided he could sue the city for violating those rights

employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action     even if  as here  the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee s behavior   the high court reversed a   ruling by the philadelphia

mayoral election  the next day  the police department demoted him from detective and transferred him to the traffic division s walking squad  a move he saw as political retaliation  justice clarence

said the real estate developer routinely profited from the financial ruin of workers in the economically depressed seaside resort town   the people he s trying to convince to vote for him are the same people he s been exploiting for years   working people  small business people   clinton said  clinton said trump s casino bankruptcies and numerous complaints against him by contractors showed he cannot be trusted to set economic policy from the white house   he makes over the top promises and says if people trust in him  put their faith in him  he ll deliver   she said   then everything falls apart  people get hurt  and donald gets paid   the trump plaza was one of four casinos trump once owned in atlantic city  he left the city after his last bankruptcy  clinton frequently uses criticism of trump s business record to illustrate a principle campaign theme   that the wealthy new yorker is only interested in boosting his financial bottom line  and not concerned about the economic struggles of working americans  clinton reminded supporters who gathered on the boardwalk under a boiling sun  within steps of the city s beach  that trump had promised to  do for the country what i did for my business   she said trump intentionally ran up hundreds of millions of debt on his companies  borrowed at high rates  defaulted on the loans  and left in the lurch the workers and contractors who relied on his casinos for income   that says everything you need to know about donald trump   clinton said   it s not about what he can build  it s about how much he can take

 extremely careless  handling of classified material on her email servers  and contradicted her claims that she never transmitted or received classified material on that email system  republican
