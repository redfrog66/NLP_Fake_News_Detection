 ##

### Phase 1: Get the Data & Models Ready
- Collect a good fake news dataset  
- Clean and prep the text (remove noise, tokenize, etc.)  
- Try out different models (like Logistic Regression, BERT, etc.)  
- See which model works best (compare results)

### Phase 2: Build the Web App (Flask)
- Create a simple web interface where you can paste text  
- Hook it up to the model so it gives a "Real" or "Fake" result  
- Make the result look clean and clear

### Phase 3: Add ChatGPT Magic (Bonus Step)
- Add a tiny ChatGPT box for follow-up questions  
- Example: "Why is this fake?" or let chatGPT generate a random true/fake news

### Phase 4: Final Touches
- Clean up the code  
- Make everything look decent  
- Write a short report / prepare presentation video
